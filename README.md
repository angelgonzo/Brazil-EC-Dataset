# Brazil-EC-Dataset
This is a quick data visualization project using Tableau and a dataset from Kaggle by Olist
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

The main goal of this project was to create relationships between these datasets in order to create map of Brazil and approx. where their vendors are located.

The database came seperated into individual datasets which contained: customer ids, geolocation, order items, payments, reviews, orders, products, sellers, and translation of the product name. 
I used Tableau Public for this particular project and began by creating a relationship between all the data sets in order to use the information such as geolocation in conjunction with seller information. 
Once this was established I created the map using the Latitude and Longitude, then I populated that with the seller zip codes, while using colors and shaped to distinguish each region. 

This gave us a colorful map that showcased the sellers of different regions, with the bigger circlers signalizing the total payment value each seller had made from their customers.

There are some noticeable locations such as Rio De Janeiro having a lot of value from customers even reaching about 140,231 BRL or ~ 24,632.77 USD.


I have uploaded all the files that I used for this project.
The csvs, and the Tableau workbook.
